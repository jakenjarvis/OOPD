## OOPD Extended Types Definition

### What are Extended Types?

This document defines **Extended Types** in Object-Oriented Prompt Design (OOPD). Extended Types complement the core **Standard Types** (defined in **`basic_terms.md`**) and are semantic, concrete types intended to clarify the intent of prompts in specific domains or usage scenarios, facilitating smoother communication with the AI.

Refer to `basic_terms.md` for the definitions of Standard Types.

The use of Extended Types is **optional**, but utilizing them enables more expressive and structured prompt design.

**【Important】** Like Standard Types, Extended Types are treated as **Basic Terms**. This means that regardless of the prompt's description language, they **must always be described using the English notation defined here (`ContentString`, `Persona`, etc.)** and are **not translated**.

### Extended Type List

To ensure the AI recognizes these extended type names as **Basic Terms (fixed keywords always used in English notation)**, the following list is defined.

```json
{
  "ExtendedTypes": ["ContentString", "Instruction", "Persona", "OutputStyle", "CodeBlock", "Ref", "SchemaDefinition", "JsonString", "YamlString", "XmlString", "Color"]
}
```

### Details of Each Extended Type

Below are the details for each defined extended type.

Note for AI: The description of multiple formats in the 'Underlying Representation/Format' for extended types indicates flexibility in the AI's internal interpretation. The AI should understand the content according to the meaning of the extended type and reflect it in processing, whether the user describes it in natural language or in a form suggesting structured data.

#### `ContentString`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents the central text block that the AI processes or generates, such as the main body of an article, report content, email body, or story text. Used to specify text as content, distinct from other metadata (like instructions or personas).
- **Use Cases:**
  - Specifying the target for summarization/translation of articles or documents.
  - Specifying the body part of reports or emails.
  - Specifying the main body part of creative works like stories or poems.
  - When wanting to indicate pure content text, distinct from code (`CodeBlock`) or instructions (`Instruction`).
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String`.
  - May also contain structured text, such as Markdown format.
- **Related Basic Terms:**
  - `String` (from `basic_terms.md`)

#### `Instruction`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents specific instructions, commands, or task details described in natural language for the AI to execute. A type for clearly indicating action requests to the AI, distinct from other information (like data or context) within the prompt. Describes content that prompts specific actions, not just explanations.
- **Use Cases:**
  - When wanting to structurally indicate the instruction part for the AI within complex prompts.
  - When defining multiple instruction steps to be executed sequentially.
  - Meta-prompting, such as treating the prompt itself as data for analysis or generation.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String`. Instruction text in natural language.
- **Related Basic Terms:**
  - `String` (from `basic_terms.md`)

#### `Persona`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents the specific role, character image, or expert stance persona setting that the AI is intended to embody. This includes the AI's response style (e.g., 'formal', 'friendly'), tone of voice (e.g., 'polite language', 'assertive tone'), assumed knowledge level (e.g., 'beginner-friendly', 'expert level'), thinking style (e.g., 'logical', 'creative'), or even a specific background (e.g., '18th-century philosopher'). Defining these elements descriptively specifies the AI's behavior.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Making the AI respond as a specific role (e.g., "skilled editor," "friendly assistant," "specific historical figure").
  - Controlling the tone and expertise level of responses.
  - Defining character dialogues or role-playing scenarios.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String` (text describing the persona) or `Dictionary` (structured attributes like name, personality, tone).
- **Related Basic Terms:**
  - `String`, `Dictionary` (from `basic_terms.md`)

#### `OutputStyle`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents composite information for specifying the format, appearance, writing style, tone, etc., of the final output generated by the AI. Describes requirements related to response formatting or style, such as "Use Markdown bullet points," "Output in JSON format," "Use polite language with an empathetic tone," or "Summarize to approximately 500 characters."
- **Use Cases:**
  - Specifying output format (e.g., Markdown, JSON, bullet points).
  - Specifying writing style (e.g., formal, casual, academic).
  - Specifying tone (e.g., polite, empathetic, assertive).
  - Specifying constraints like character limits or summarization levels.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `Dictionary` (with attributes like `format: String`, `tone: String`, `length: Number`).
  - Or, a simple `String` (e.g., "JSON format, polite tone").
- **Related Basic Terms:**
  - `Dictionary`, `String`, `Number` (from `basic_terms.md`)

#### `CodeBlock`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents a snippet of code itself written in a specific programming language. Used to specify the target code when requesting the AI to generate, explain, review, or debug code, or to provide code examples as reference. Co-notating the language type (e.g., 'Python', 'JavaScript') is recommended but not required.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Specifying the target for instructions like code generation, explanation, review, debugging, or translation.
  - Embedding sample or reference code within the prompt.
  - Clearly distinguishing between text parts and code parts.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String` (the code itself).
  - Can also be represented as a `Dictionary` with an attribute specifying the language (e.g., `language: String`).
- **Related Basic Terms:**
  - `String`, `Dictionary` (from `basic_terms.md`)

#### `Ref`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents an identifier indicating reference information or location to external resources or other data. Specifically, this includes web page URLs, file system paths, API endpoints, database record IDs, or links to image or video files. Used as the reference target when the AI accesses these resources or refers to them.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Specifying web page URLs.
  - Specifying local or remote file paths.
  - Specifying API endpoints.
  - Specifying links or identifiers to images, audio, or video files.
  - Indicating references to other data, such as database record IDs.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String`. Various formats of strings like URL, file path, URN, data URI.
- **Related Basic Terms:**
  - `String`, `UniqueID` (from `basic_terms.md`)

#### `SchemaDefinition`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents a data structure definition, schema, or data model itself described in text format. Examples include JSON Schema definitions, database table definitions (like CREATE TABLE statements), or class structure definitions. Used when instructing the AI to generate data based on a specific structure or to analyze/explain the data structure itself.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Instructing data generation based on a specific schema.
  - Requesting the AI to define or explain a data structure.
  - Specifying data validation rules.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String` (the schema definition described in text).
  - Often represented by `JsonString` or `YamlString`.
- **Related Basic Terms:**
  - `String` (from `basic_terms.md`), `JsonString`, `YamlString` (defined in this file)

#### `JsonString`
