## OOPD Extended Types Definition

### What are Extended Types?

This document defines the **Extended Types** in Object-Oriented Prompt Design (OOPD). Extended Types complement the core **Standard Types** of OOPD and are semantic, concrete types aimed at clarifying the intent of prompts in specific domains or usage scenarios, facilitating smoother communication with the AI.

Refer to `core.md` for the definitions of Standard Types (`String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, etc.).

The use of Extended Types is **optional**, but leveraging them enables more expressive and structured prompt design. Like Standard Types, Extended Types are **described using their defined English notation, regardless of the prompt description language**.

### Extended Type List

The following list defines the extended type names for the AI to recognize as fixed keywords.

```json
{
  "ExtendedTypes": ["ContentString", "Instruction", "Persona", "OutputStyle", "CodeBlock", "Ref", "SchemaDefinition", "JsonString", "YamlString", "XmlString", "Color"]
}
```

### Regarding the Underlying Representation/Format of Extended Types

For some Extended Types, the "Underlying Representation/Format" described later indicates multiple forms (e.g., String or Dictionary). This primarily shows flexibility for the AI's internal handling. Users typically just need to describe the intended content for that Extended Type naturally within the prompt (e.g., a description for Persona, instructions regarding output format or tone for OutputStyle), and the AI will select and interpret the appropriate internal representation based on context. It is also possible for users to explicitly describe them in a specific format (e.g., Dictionary).

### Details of Each Extended Type

Below are the details for each defined Extended Type.

#### `ContentString`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents the primary long-form text content. Intended to indicate the central text block for AI processing or generation, such as articles, reports, email bodies, or stories.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Specifying the target for summarizing or translating articles or documents.
  - Specifying the body section of reports or emails.
  - Specifying the main part of creative works like stories or poems.
  - Distinguishing pure content text from code (`CodeBlock`) or instructions (`Instruction`).
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String`.
  - May include structured text, such as Markdown format.
- **Related Standard Types:**
  - `String`

#### `Instruction`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents specific instructions, commands, or task descriptions for the AI. Clearly indicates the action the AI should perform, distinct from other parts of the prompt (data or context).
- **Use Cases:**
  - Structurally indicating the instruction part for the AI within complex prompts.
  - Defining multiple instruction steps for sequential execution.
  - Metaprompting, where the prompt itself is treated as data for analysis or generation.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String`. Instruction text in natural language.
- **Related Standard Types:**
  - `String`

#### `Persona`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents the persona settings for the role, character, expert, etc., that the AI should embody. Defines the AI's response style, tone, knowledge level, thinking style, etc.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Having the AI respond as a specific role (e.g., "a seasoned editor," "a friendly assistant," "a specific historical figure").
  - Controlling the tone and expertise of the response.
  - Defining character dialogues or role-playing scenarios.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String` (text describing the persona) or `Dictionary` (structured attributes like name, personality, tone).
- **Related Standard Types:**
  - `String`, `Dictionary`

#### `OutputStyle`

- **Meaning:**
  A composite type for specifying the format, style, tone, etc., of the output generated by the AI. Conveys how the response should be formatted.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Specifying the output format (e.g., Markdown, JSON, bullet points).
  - Specifying the writing style (e.g., formal, casual, academic).
  - Specifying the tone (e.g., polite, empathetic, assertive).
  - Specifying constraints like character limits or summarization levels.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `Dictionary` (with attributes like `format: String`, `tone: String`, `length: Number`).
  - Or, a simple `String` (e.g., "In JSON format, with a polite tone").
- **Related Standard Types:**
  - `Dictionary`, `String`, `Number`

#### `CodeBlock`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents a snippet of code written in a specific programming language. Expected to have the language type as an attribute.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Specifying the target for instructions like code generation, explanation, review, debugging, or translation.
  - Embedding sample or reference code within the prompt.
  - Clearly distinguishing code parts from text parts.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String` (the code itself).
  - Can also be represented as a `Dictionary` with an attribute specifying the language (e.g., `language: String`).
- **Related Standard Types:**
  - `String`, `Dictionary`

#### `Ref`

- **Meaning:**
  Information indicating a reference or location of some resource (web page, file, API endpoint, data, image, audio, video, etc.). Similar to the concept of a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
- **Use Cases:**
  - Specifying a web page URL.
  - Specifying a local or remote file path.
  - Specifying an API endpoint.
  - Specifying links or identifiers for image, audio, or video files.
  - Indicating references to other data, such as database record IDs.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String`. Various formats of strings like URL, file path, URN, data URI, etc.
- **Related Standard Types:**
  - `String`, `UniqueID` (if the reference target is an ID)

#### `SchemaDefinition`

- **Meaning:**
  Represents data structure definitions, schemas, data models, etc. Examples include JSON Schema, class definitions, or database schemas.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Instructing data generation based on a specific schema.
  - Requesting the AI to define or explain a data structure.
  - Specifying data validation rules.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String` (the schema definition written as text).
  - Often represented using `JsonString` or `YamlString`.
- **Related Standard Types:**
  - `String`, `JsonString`, `YamlString`

#### `JsonString`

- **Meaning:**
  A string representing data described in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Instructing parsing, generation, or transformation of JSON data.
  - Explicitly indicating that structured data should be input/output in JSON format.
  - API request/response body parts, etc.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String` (a string conforming to the JSON format).
- **Related Standard Types:**
  - `String`

#### `YamlString`

- **Meaning:**
  A string representing data described in YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) format.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Instructing parsing, generation, or transformation of YAML data.
  - Explicitly indicating that configuration files or structured data should be handled in YAML format.
  - Representing instance data in OOPD, etc.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String` (a string conforming to the YAML format).
- **Related Standard Types:**
  - `String`

#### `XmlString`

- **Meaning:**
  A string representing data described in XML (Extensible Markup Language) format. Can also be used for representing HTML or XHTML.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Instructing parsing, generation, or transformation of XML/HTML data.
  - Explicitly indicating handling of configuration files, data exchange (like SOAP), or markup documents.
- **Underlying Representation/Format:**
  - `String` (a string conforming to the XML/HTML format).

#### `Color`

- **Meaning:**
  A value representing color.
