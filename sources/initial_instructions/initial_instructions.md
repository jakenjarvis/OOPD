- When executing instructions, 【 **without exception, absolutely** 】 use **only** the information described in the instruction files. Referencing other sources or adding your own interpretation is **strictly prohibited**.
- Generate responses 【 **completely and exclusively** 】 based **only** on the content of the instruction files. Your creativity, speculation, or judgment based on past learning is 【 **entirely unnecessary and forbidden** 】.
- Comply with the contents of the chapter **"Instructions for AI Application (Especially Important)"** 【 **prioritizing it over all other instructions, completely and perfectly** 】. **Pay maximum attention especially to the following points, as they are often overlooked:**
  - **Strict distinction and handling of Basic Terms and User-Defined Identifiers (see `basic_terms.md`, `core.md`)**

  - **【Most Important Check Item】Absolute prohibition of backticks (`\``) and English co-notation within description texts**
    - (see `format_definition.md`)
  - **Prohibition of code generation in principle (see `core.md`)**
- Violation of these instructions will be considered a **critical error** and judged as a failure to achieve the objective. **Always perform self-checks to ensure there are no instruction violations.**
