## OOPD Translation Rules Directory

### Overview

This directory (`translation_rules/`) contains files that define **language-specific translation rules** for Object-Oriented Prompt Design (OOPD). These rules are used by the AI to **bidirectionally translate** user-defined "User-Defined Identifiers" (class names, method names, property names, etc.) between the hub language, **English (`en`)**, and other supported languages.

These rules are core to OOPD's multilingual support capabilities and are essential for ensuring consistency between prompts written in different languages and natural expression in each language.

For the overall translation strategy and hub language model, refer to `localization_overview.md` in the root directory.

### Directory Structure and File Naming Convention

- Translation rules for each language are managed as separate Markdown files.
- File names follow the format **`{language_code}_rules.md`**.
  - `{language_code}` uses the 2-letter lowercase language code from **ISO 639-1** (e.g., `ja`, `fr`, `de`). If necessary, consider concatenating a region code (e.g., `zh_cn`, `pt_br`) with an underscore.
- Examples:
  - `ja_rules.md`: Japanese translation rules
  - `fr_rules.md`: French translation rules
  - `zh_cn_rules.md`: Rules for Chinese (Simplified)

### Content of Each Language Rule File

Each `{language_code}_rules.md` file should include the following information (refer to existing rule files or templates for details):

1. **Language Code:** Clearly state the language code (`language_code`) the file targets.
2. **English → Target Language Translation Rules:**
   - **Name Conversion Rules** for translating English hub names to the target language (for each element type). This includes naming conventions (suffixes, etc.) in the target language.
   - **Translation Patterns** for specific English expressions/structures corresponding to target language patterns.
   - **Handling of Specific Words/Expressions** to note when translating to the target language.
3. **Target Language → English Translation Rules:**
   - **Name Conversion Rules** for converting target language expressions to English hub names (conforming to standard English naming conventions).
   - **Translation Patterns** for target language expressions/structures corresponding to English hub name patterns.
   - **Handling of Specific Words/Expressions** to note when translating from the target language.
4. **Language-Specific Notes:**
   - Grammar, character codes, idiomatic expressions, and other considerations specific to that language.

Rules should be described in a structured manner, as much as possible, to be easily interpretable by the AI.

### Usage by AI

Typically, AI systems do not read these individual language rule files directly. Instead, they utilize a **single combined rule file** (e.g., `ai_combined_translation_rules.md`) generated by an automated process like GitHub Actions. The AI refers to this combined file and applies the appropriate rule set based on the prompt's processing language or the requested output language.

### Contributing

To expand OOPD's multilingual support, contributions for adding translation rules for new languages or improving existing rules are welcome.

- **Adding rules for a new language:**
  1. Check the ISO 639-1 code for the target language and create a `{language_code}_rules.md` file.
  2. Referencing existing rule files (e.g., `ja_rules.md`), describe the rules according to the "Content of Each Language Rule File" section above. Also refer to the English specification (`english_specification.md`) and the localization overview (`localization_overview.md`).
  3. Deep knowledge of the target language (preferably native level) is required. Please give sufficient consideration to naming conventions and natural expressions.
  4. Propose via pull request, etc.
- **Improving existing rules:**
  - Modify the target language file (`{language_code}_rules.md`) and propose improvements.

We appreciate your cooperation in developing accurate and natural translation rules.
