## OOPD Translation Rules Directory

### Overview

This directory (`translation_rules/`) stores files defining **language-specific translation rules** for Object-Oriented Prompt Design (OOPD). These rules are used by the AI to **bidirectionally translate** user-defined "User-Defined Identifiers" (such as class names, method names, property names, etc.) between the hub language, **English (`en`)**, and each supported other language.

These rules are core to OOPD's multilingual support feature and are essential for ensuring consistency between prompts written in different languages and natural expression in each language.

Refer to `localization_overview.md` in the root directory for the overall translation strategy and hub language model.

### Directory Structure and File Naming Convention

- Translation rules for each language are managed as separate Markdown files.
- File names follow the format **`{language_code}_rules.md`**.
  - `{language_code}` uses the 2-letter lowercase language code from **ISO 639-1** (e.g., `ja`, `fr`, `de`). Using regional codes (e.g., `zh_cn`, `pt_br`) connected by an underscore is also considered if necessary.
- Examples:
  - `ja_rules.md`: Japanese translation rules
  - `fr_rules.md`: French translation rules
  - `zh_cn_rules.md`: Rules for Chinese (Simplified)

### Content of Each Language Rule File

Each `{language_code}_rules.md` file must include the following information (refer to existing rule files or templates for details):

1. **Language Code:** Clearly state the language code (`language_code`) the file targets.
2. **English → Target Language Translation Rules:**
   - **Name Conversion Rules** for translating English hub names into the target language (for each element type). This includes naming conventions in the target language (suffixes, etc.).
   - **Translation Patterns** for the target language corresponding to specific English expressions or structures.
   - **Handling of Specific Words/Expressions** to note when translating into the target language.
3. **Target Language → English Translation Rules:**
   - **Name Conversion Rules** for converting target language expressions into English hub names (compliant with standard English naming conventions).
   - **Translation Patterns** for English hub names corresponding to target language expressions or structures.
   - **Handling of Specific Words/Expressions** to note when translating from the target language.
4. **Language-Specific Notes:**
   - Grammar, character encoding, idiomatic expressions, and other considerations specific to the language.

Please structure the rules as much as possible to be easily interpretable by the AI.

### AI Usage

Typically, AI systems do not read these individual language rule files directly. Instead, they utilize a **single combined rule file** (e.g., `ai_combined_translation_rules.md`) generated by automated processes like GitHub Actions. The AI refers to this combined file and applies the appropriate rule set based on the prompt language being processed or the requested output language.

### Contribution

Contributions to expand OOPD's multilingual support by adding translation rules for new languages or improving existing rules are welcome.

- **Adding Rules for a New Language:**
  1. Confirm the ISO 639-1 code for the target language and create a `{language_code}_rules.md` file.
  2. Referencing existing rule files (e.g., `ja_rules.md`), describe the rules according to the "Content of Each Language Rule File" section above. Also, refer to the English specification (`english_specification.md`) and the localization overview (`localization_overview.md`).
  3. Deep knowledge of the target language (preferably native level) is required. Please give sufficient consideration to naming conventions and natural expressions.
  4. Propose via pull requests, etc.
- **Improving Existing Rules:**
  - Modify the target language file (`{language_code}_rules.md`) and propose improvements.

We appreciate your cooperation in developing accurate and natural translation rules.
